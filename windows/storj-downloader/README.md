Basically continually downloads everything in a bucket then deletes the file locally and does it again until the end of time

Update #bucket and #password within ps1 file

From there it should run putting everything in your windows temp storj folder


VERY VERY beta; run at your own risk

Meant to be an example of one way to utilize powershell with storj (not natively)
